# SqlStudioLite
Powershell + WPF to connect to and run queries on a MSSQL database

I was waiting too long for APPV to deploy SQL studio so that I could run some queries so out of necessity I started running SQL queries in PS from the command line.
This expanded to a simple WPF GUI to make it a bit easier to change query and database.
I find I am using this more than SQL Management Studio as time goes on.

Enjoy!
